# Bridge Co-Parenting Platform - Development Guide

## 📋 Streamlined Documentation for Development

The original PRD has been optimized into two focused documents for efficient development:

### 1. **[Developer PRD](./frontend/DEV-PRD.md)** ⚙️
**Technical specifications for building features**

Contains:
- Core architecture & data models
- MVP feature specifications with technical requirements
- API endpoint definitions
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Design system specifications
- Security and compliance requirements
- Development setup instructions

👉 **Use this for:** Building features, understanding technical requirements, API integration

---

### 2. **[Feature Checklist](./FEATURE-CHECKLIST.md)** ✅
**Track what's built vs. what's needed**

Contains:
- Complete feature inventory with status (✅ ❌ 🚧)
- Frontend vs backend completion tracking
- Priority roadmap
- API endpoint coverage
- MVP progress metrics (currently ~45% complete)
- Next steps and immediate priorities

👉 **Use this for:** Sprint planning, progress tracking, identifying gaps, prioritizing work

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Current Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Python 3.11 + FastAPI + MongoDB
- **Auth:** JWT with bcrypt
- **AI:** Placeholder (ready for GPT-4/Claude integration)

### What's Already Built:
✅ Landing pages & marketing content  
✅ Authentication system (signup, login, JWT)  
✅ Family creation & linking (Family Code system)  
✅ Onboarding flow UI  
✅ Calendar UI (complete)  
✅ Messaging UI (complete)  
✅ Expense tracker UI (complete)  
✅ Bridgette avatar system  
✅ Contract upload (basic AI parsing simulation)

### Top Priorities (Need Building):
1. 🔥 **Calendar Backend API** - Create/edit/delete events, change requests
2. 🔥 **Messaging Backend API** - Conversations, send messages, immutable logs
3. 🔥 **Expense Backend API** - CRUD operations, disputes, receipts
4. 🔥 **Dashboard Page** - Main app landing after login
5. 🔥 **Real-time Sync** - WebSocket/polling for calendar/messages

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Core Principles:
1. **Emotionally Intelligent** - Calming UX, empathetic microcopy, low cognitive load
2. **Fair & Balanced** - Equal access for both parents, transparent logging
3. **Child-First** - Every feature prioritizes children's best interests
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Features introduced step-by-step, minimal decision fatigue
5. **Conflict Prevention** - Proactive suggestions over reactive fixes

### Color System:
- `bridge-blue` (#3b82f6) - Primary actions, trust
- `bridge-green` (#10b981) - Success, balanced decisions
- `bridge-yellow` (#f59e0b) - Warnings, pending items
- `bridge-red` (#ef4444) - Urgent, disputes
- `bridge-black` (#1f2937) - Text

### Bridgette AI Assistant:
- **Visual:** Justice/balance symbol avatar (covered eyes, scales)
- **Personality:** Neutral, helpful, empathetic, never judgmental
- **Expressions:** happy, thinking, encouraging, celebrating, waving, balanced
- **Role:** Context-aware guidance, alternative solutions, emotional support

## 🔄 Removed from Original PRD

The following sections were removed to streamline development documentation:

**Business/Marketing Content:**
- Market insights (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Competitor analysis
- Detailed user personas (Rachel & Mark story)
- RICE framework scoring
- Positioning statements
- Roll-out strategy
- Stakeholder communication plans

**Rationale:** Valuable for product strategy but not needed for day-to-day coding. Development team should focus on technical specifications in the DEV-PRD.

**Technology Change:**
- Original PRD specified: React Native + Vue.js + Node.js
- Actual implementation: React + TypeScript + Python FastAPI + MongoDB
- Decision: Continue with current stack (working well)
