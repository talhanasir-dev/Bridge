# Bridge Co-Parenting Platform - Developer PRD

**Last Updated:** November 10, 2025  
**Stack:** React + TypeScript (Frontend) | Python FastAPI + MongoDB (Backend)

---

## Overview

Bridge is an AI-powered co-parenting coordinator that helps separated or divorced parents organize logistics, manage calendars, reduce emotional stress, and proactively solve conflicts. The platform uses Bridgette (AI assistant) to provide emotionally intelligent guidance throughout the user experience.

---

## Core Architecture

### Authentication
- Email + password authentication with JWT tokens
- OAuth2 Bearer token flow
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- User roles: Parent 1, Parent 2, Lawyer, Child (read-only)

### Family Linking System
- Parent 1 creates family profile → generates unique 6-character Family Code
- Parent 2 uses Family Code to link their account
- Shared data model for both parents
- Each user maintains separate app instance with personalized views

### Data Models

**User:**
- firstName, lastName, email, password (hashed), role

**Family:**
- familyName, familyCode (6-char unique)
- parent1_email, parent2_email
- parent1_name, parent2_name
- children[], custodyAgreement, custodyArrangement
- createdAt, linkedAt

**Child:**
- name, dateOfBirth, grade, school
- allergies, medications, notes

**Custody Agreement:**
- fileName, uploadDate, parsedData (AI-extracted)
- custodySchedule, holidaySchedule, decisionMaking
- expenseSplit (ratio + percentages)

**Calendar Event:**
- date, type (custody/holiday/school/medical/activity)
- title, parent (mom/dad/both), isSwappable

**Change Request:**
- event_id, requestedBy_email, status (pending/approved/rejected)
- requestedDate, reason, createdAt

## API Design Standards

### Authentication
All protected endpoints require Bearer token:

Authorization: Bearer {jwt_token}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Format
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "details": []
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-11-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

```bash
# Backend
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bridge
DATABASE_NAME=bridge

# Frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Running Locally:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Key Decisions & Constraints

1. **No real-time chat** - Messages are asynchronous to reduce conflict escalation
2. **Mandatory Family Code** - Ensures both parents explicitly agree to use platform
3. **Immutable logs** - All actions are permanent for legal compliance
4. **Tone selection** - Forces users to think about communication style
5. **Children best interest** - Default state for all conflict resolution suggestions

---

## Glossary

- **Family Code**: Unique 6-character code for linking parent accounts
- **Bridgette**: AI assistant persona (justice/balance symbol)
- **Custody Event**: Calendar event representing parenting time
- **Swappable Event**: Event that can be exchanged with another date
- **Change Request**: Formal request to modify calendar
- **Tone**: Communication style for messages (friendly/matter-of-fact/legal)
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable log of all platform actions
- **Court-Ready**: Formatted for legal proceedings
